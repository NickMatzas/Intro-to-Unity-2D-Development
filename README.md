# Intro to 2D Development in Unity
Taking Jesse Freeman's courses on 2D development essentials on Lynda.com

There are 5 main courses to take:

<b>1) Learning Unity 2D Scripting </b><br>
<b>2) Learning Unity 2D Sprites  </b><br>
<b>3) Unity 2D: Building an Adventure Game </b><br>
<b>4) Unity 2D: Building a Tile Map Editor </b><br>
<b>5) Unity 2D: Level Design </b><br>

The scripts created in each course will be in this repository.

All files will be named in a way that corresponds to the course in which the script was made.<br>
For example, scripts for course #3 will be named 3.1) x, 3.2) y, 3.3) z etc.

This repository only serves as a personal log where I document the scripts written on the courses I take
